title: "MPD: Using beets to manage your music!"
---
MPD is an excellent way to play your music collection, but you do not want to depend on MPD or its
database. Maybe you want to use your library also in other playback programms.

[Beets](http://beets.radbox.org/) is a really beautiful Python application. It allows you to import
your music collection, while fetching metadata from online databases like [musicbrainz.org](https://musicbrainz.org/) or [discogs.com](http://www.discogs.com/).
There are also some plugins available which allow you to fetch genres from LastFm, fetch music
art images or create intelligent auto-updating playlists, which use regex to match songs.
This allows to to create an (almost) perfect music library with minimal effort.

Here's my config with some more plugins. You can look them up [here](https://beets.readthedocs.org/en/v1.3.13/plugins/index.html).
