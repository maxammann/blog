The Kingrinder K6 is a popular manual coffee grinder known for its consistent grind quality and durability. However, after only 6 months of use with the Ross Droplet Technique (RDT), my K6's bearings failed prematurely due to rust damage. The small amount of water I was adding to coffee beans (0.5-1g) to reduce static and improve grind consistency created moisture that found its way to the internal bearings, causing rapid corrosion. This post documents the complete bearing replacement process necessitated by this unexpected failure.

## Bearing Inspection - The RDT Problem

The old bearings show significant rust damage despite being relatively new - they lasted only 6 months instead of the expected years of service. This premature failure was caused by moisture exposure from using the Ross Droplet Technique (RDT), where I was adding 0.5-1g of water to the coffee beans before grinding to reduce static and improve grind consistency. While RDT is excellent for grind quality, the small amount of water vapor created during grinding found its way to the bearings, causing rapid corrosion of the steel components.

This discovery was a wake-up call about the potential downsides of RDT in grinders not designed for moisture exposure. The rust was extensive enough to cause noticeable grinding resistance and noise, making bearing replacement unavoidable.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, gather all the necessary tools and replacement parts:
- Replacement bearings (check your model's specifications)
- New circlips
- Circlip pliers
- Small screwdrivers
- Calipers for measuring
- Clean workspace

## Complete Disassembly

Start by completely disassembling the grinder. Remove the hopper, adjustment ring, and carefully work your way down to access the internal components. Take photos as you go to remember the assembly order.

## Bearing Replacement

The new bearing fits perfectly and should provide smooth, quiet operation for years to come.

## Axle Assembly Process

The axle assembly process requires patience and precision. Make sure the bearing is properly seated and the axle moves freely without binding.

## Measurements and Tolerances

Precise measurements are crucial for proper operation. The axle width must match the bearing specifications exactly.

## Burr Components

While servicing the bearings, it's a good opportunity to clean the burrs thoroughly and inspect them for wear.

## Circlip Replacement

One of the most critical parts of this service is replacing the circlips that secure the bearings in place.

## Precise Measurements

Getting the circlip dimensions exactly right is crucial for proper retention force:

## Final Assembly and Results

After careful reassembly in reverse order, the Kingrinder K6 operates like new. The grinding action is smooth and quiet, with no play in the axle. The investment in quality replacement parts and the time spent on proper service pays off in extended grinder life and improved coffee quality.

## Tips for Success

1. **Take photos** at each step of disassembly
2. **Use proper tools** - especially circlip pliers
3. **Measure twice** - verify all dimensions before installation
4. **Work clean** - any debris can affect bearing life
5. **Don't rush** - precision is more important than speed
6. **Consider RDT implications** - if using the Ross Droplet Technique, be aware that moisture can reach internal components and cause premature wear

The Kingrinder K6 is designed to be serviceable, and with the right approach, you can restore it to like-new condition. However, this experience taught me to be more cautious about moisture exposure when using techniques like RDT. For future use, I'm considering either using less water or finding alternative static reduction methods to prevent another premature bearing failure.
